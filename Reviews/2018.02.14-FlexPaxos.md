Flexible Paxos: Quorum Intersection Revisited

### Summary

In this paper, the authors describe Flexible Paxos (FPaxos), which is a generalization of the classic Paxos algorithm. FPaxos is based on the observation that each of the phases of Paxos may use non-intersecting quorums. By taking this weakening of the requirements, developers will have more control over the choice between performance and availability. At first, the authors revisit the classic Paxos algorithm and observe that the description of Paxos is more conservative than is necessary. Thus, they propose their own improvements over Paxos and design FPaxos by making use of many non-intersecting quorum systems. Next, the authors present three different example quorum systems to demonstrate the utility of FPaxos: (1) majority quorums; (2) simple quorums; (3) grid quorums. After that, proofs of safety for FPaxos are given in the paper. At last, the authors implement FPaxos and evaluate its performance.

### Contributions

- This paper is the first to prove and implement the generalization over Paxos to provide flexible quorums. (i.e., FPaxos)
- The authors design and implement FPaxos. They also evaluate its performance and discuss some possible enhancement strategies.

### Strengths

- FPaxos allows greater flexibility. By exposing replication quorum size to developers, they can get more flexibilities to choose their own trade-off between failure tolerance and steady-state latency.
- In FPaxos, the authors remove the limit on scalability, because replication quorums are no longer required to intersect.

### Weaknesses

- Exposing the replication quorum size to developers may lead to misconfiguration of FPaxos, because this configuration may require some domain knowledge.
